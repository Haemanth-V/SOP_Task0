The answer in my view is 'Eggs'.

This is because the first ever chicken was produced from the zygote of two 
almost-chickens(called proto-chickens) by genetic mutation. The diversity of 
life that exists today is a result of many modifications to the primitve forms
that existed millions of years ago and hence chicken should also have a 
non-chicken ancestor. Moreover eggs(in general) have shown up over 300 million
years ago but chicken dates back to only around 58 thousand years ago. So, since
the question is not specifically about chicken eggs, rather eggs in general, I
believe eggs came first and then did chickens.
